#+TITLE: magnatune.el

This library lets you browse through [[http://www.magnatune.com][magnatune's]] great music
collection using emacs. The [[https://sqlite.org/][sqlite3]] tool is required for this to work.

When on an artist, album or song the ~magnatune-open-item-at-point~
command collects the stream urls and calls a hook. There are three
provided hook functions:

1. add the urls via emac's built in ~mpc~ library to the current
   playlist of a local mpd
2. add the urls to emms' playlist
3. pass the urls to some external player

Magnatune provides its catalog as an sqlite3 file at [[http://magnatune.com/info/sqlite-normalized][this site]]. This
file is downloaded and the =sqlite3= program is used to search the
database. To be polite, by default the gzipped database file is
downloaded and unzipped using the local =gzip= command. If this does
not exist on your platform, then you can set ~magnatune-enable-gzip~
to ~nil~. The database file is checked every week for updates and
redownloaded, if it changed upstream.

Since 0.5.0 there is a helm interface to the catalog which you can
invoke with ~magnatune-helm~.

* Installation

Install [[http://www.sqlite.org/download.html][sqlite]] first, on most linuxes it is often already installed,
or just use your package manager. It's also recommended to install
[[http://www.gzip.org/][gzip]]. Again on most *nixes this is usually already there.

You can install it from [[http://melpa.org][MELPA]] via ~package.el~, by doing

#+begin_example
M-x package-install RET magnatune
#+end_example

Or clone the repository and add it to Emac's ~load-path~. Then require
the file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle
(require 'magnatune)
#+end_src

The helm interface is provided via

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(require 'magnatune-helm)
#+end_src

* Configuration

For membership stream urls, you need to set username and password.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(setq magnatune-username "username")
(setq magnatune-password "password")
#+end_src

To enable the open command, add a function to the
~magnatune-open-urls-hook~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(add-hook 'magnatune-open-urls-hook 'magnatune-mpc-url-hook)
;; or
;; (add-hook 'magnatune-open-urls-hook 'magnatune-external-url-hook)
;; (add-hook 'magnatune-open-urls-hook 'magnatune-emms-url-hook)
#+end_src

If using ~magnatune-external-url-hook~ you also might want to set
~magnatune-external-player~ to the desired player command. If using
~magnatune-emms-url-hook~, you need to have [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emms/][emms]] configured.

The hook functions are called with the url list and a second optional
argument which is the prefix arg if used (in raw form). The provided
hooks (for mpd and emms) simply add the urls to the current
playlist. If a prefix arg is given, the playlist is cleared before.

If you don't have a ~gzip~ command on your system, disable the use of
it (by default it is enabled):
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(setq magnatune-enable-gzip nil)
#+end_src

The location of the ~sqlite3~ command can be configured, too:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(setq magnatune-sqlite-cmd "/usr/local/bin/sqlite3")
#+end_src

* Usage

** standard interface

The ~magnatune-browse~ function is the entry point to the
collection. Usually it's convenient to have a key binding for it:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(global-set-key (kbd "C-<f11>") 'magnatune-browse)
#+end_src

It will ask whether to display a list of artists, albums or genres.

If called with prefix argument, it asks for a search string (only for
artists and albums). Use SQLs ~%~ character to do prefix searches; for
example ~A%~ finds all artists or albums whose name starts with ~A~.

In the following buffer, try the keys below.

** helm interface

The function ~magnatune-helm~ starts a helm interface to the music
catalog (all genres, arists and albums). On artist, album or song the
persistent action opens a buffer with a description of the current
item (same buffer as with standard interface). When on a song, a
description of the album of this song is shown.

The “play” action is bound to ~C-a~. It appends the tracks of the
current item to the playlist. With prefix, the playlist is cleared
first. It is a persistent action, so you can add to the playlist
without quitting the helm session.

The default action steps into the current item and you can go back
with ~C-.~.

* Key bindings

There are some default bindings:

| Key                | Description                                                          |
|--------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /                  | Go to the item starting with some prefix                             |
| A-Z                | Go to the first item in the list starting with this letter.          |
| e                  | Load the next result chunk from the db.                              |

| q                  | Bury or kill the buffer.                                             |
| s                  | When listing all albums ask for an order to apply.                   |
| RET                | Go to the next level.                                                |
