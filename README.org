#+TITLE: magnatune.el

This library lets you browse through [[http://www.magnatune.com][magnatune's]] great music
collection using emacs. The [[https://sqlite.org/][sqlite3]] tool is required for this to work.

When on an artist, album or song the ~magnatune-open-item-at-point~
command collects the stream urls and calls a hook. There are two
provided hook functions:

- one adds the urls via emac's built in ~mpc~ library to the current
  playlist of a local mpd
- a second passes the urls to some external player

Magnatune provides its catalog as an sqlite3 file at [[http://magnatune.com/info/sqlite-normalized][this site]]. This
file is downloaded and the =sqlite3= program is used to search the
database. To be polite, by default the gzipped database file is
downloaded and unzipped using the local =gzip= command. If this does
not exist on your platform, then you can set ~magnatune-enable-gzip~
to ~nil~. The database file is checked every week for updates and
redownloaded, if it changed upstream.

* Installation

Install [[http://www.sqlite.org/download.html][sqlite]] first, on most linuxes it is often already installed,
or just use your package manager. It's also recommended to install
[[http://www.gzip.org/][gzip]]. Again on most *nixes this is usually already there.

Then clone the repository and add it to Emac's ~load-path~. Then
require the file

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle
(require 'magnatune)
#+end_src

* Configuration

For membership stream urls, you need to set username and password.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(setq magnatune-username "username")
(setq magnatune-password "password")
#+end_src

To enable the open command, add a function to the
~magnatune-open-urls-hook~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(add-hook 'magnatune-open-urls-hook 'magnatune-mpc-url-hook)
;; or
;; (add-hook 'magnatune-open-urls-hook 'magnatune-external-url-hook)
#+end_src

If using ~magnatune-external-url-hook~ you also might want to set
~magnatune-external-player~ to the desired player command.

The hook functions are called with the url list and a second optional
argument which is the prefix arg if used (in raw form).

If you don't have a ~gzip~ command on your system, disable the use of
it (by default it is enabled):
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(setq magnatune-enable-gzip nil)
#+end_src

The location of the ~sqlite3~ command can be configured, too:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(setq magnatune-sqlite-cmd "/usr/local/bin/sqlite3")
#+end_src

The ~magnatune-browse~ function is the entry point to the
collection. Usually it's convenient to have a key binding for it:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(global-set-key (kbd "C-<f11>") 'magnatune-browse)
#+end_src

* Key bindings

There are some default bindings:
